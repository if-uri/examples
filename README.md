## Examples

Numbered roughly from basics to advanced. Each folder is `NN-name/` with its own
`README.md`.

See [`AUTOMATION-INTEGRATIONS.md`](AUTOMATION-INTEGRATIONS.md) for the URI→registry→LLM
pattern and a plan for browser/email/KSeF/government connectors.

All host-runnable checks pass with `urirun` installed (e.g. from
`github.com/if-uri/urirun`). Docker-based demos (08, 11 and the full 09 flow)
require Docker.

The noVNC LAN flow now has a full four-computer smoke test:

```bash
cd 11-novnc_lan_flow
make test-full
```

It executes 16 URI steps across 24 generated routes and verifies screenshots
from `pc1`, `pc2`, `pc3` and `pc4`.

Full installer/connector/registry scenario:

```bash
cd 12-full_e2e_connect_lab
make test
```

The full Docker scenario installs available connectors from
`connect.ifuri.com`, runs host-node communication across `pc1` and `pc2`,
executes connector URI routes, verifies gRPC transport, and checks MCP tools plus
A2A skills. Current connector Docker coverage is `planfile`, `sqlite-context`,
`domain-monitor`, `http-check`, `time-tools`, `namecheap-dns`,
`browser-control` and `grpc-transport`; planned catalog entry `mqtt` is
reported as skipped until its package exists.

## Run all tests

```bash
make test          # or: ./run_tests.sh
```

Runs the host-runnable check for every `NN-*` example and prints a summary.
It auto-detects a Python with `urirun` (prefers `../app/.venv`; override with
`PYTHON=...`) and skips the Docker-only demos (08, 11 and the full 09 flow).
Current host run: **20 passed, 0 failed, 4 skipped**.
